This is a PCL version of the original [MarkdownSharp](https://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/) project.

Original ReadMe

Open source C# implementation of [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) processor, as featured on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/).

This port is based heavily on the original [Perl 1.0.1](http://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/source/browse/MarkdownSharpTests/source/perl/Markdown.101.pl) and [Perl 1.0.2b8](http://code.google.com/p/markdownsharp/source/browse/MarkdownSharpTests/source/perl/Markdown.102b8.pl) implementations of Markdown, with bits and pieces of the apparently much better maintained [PHP Markdown](http://michelf.com/projects/php-markdown/) folded into it. There are a few Stack Overflow specific modifications (which are all configurable, and all off by default). I'd like to ensure that this version stays within shouting distance of the Markdown "specification", such as it is...

Please contribute!
You'll need to know:

 - C#
 - Regular Expressions (I mean really freaking know them -- the original Markdown implementation was in Perl. Consider yourselves warned.)
 - Markdown
